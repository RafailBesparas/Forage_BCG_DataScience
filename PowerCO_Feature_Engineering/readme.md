# 📊 Feature Engineering – Rafail Besparas Project
- This module focuses on feature engineering, a crucial preprocessing step for improving model performance and interpretability in a machine learning pipeline.
- The notebook transforms raw data into meaningful features that enable better predictive power for downstream ML models.

# 🧠 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw tabular data
- Encode categorical variables
- Handle missing values
- Generate new features based on domain insights
- Standardize and scale numerical features
- Prepare data for machine learning model training

# 📁 Data Overview
- The dataset appears to include:
1. Demographic features
2. Financial indicators
3. Behavioral variables
- These are common in customer analytics, credit scoring, or risk prediction use cases.

# ⚙️ Key Feature Engineering Steps
1. Handling Missing Values
- Specific features with high missingness were either imputed or dropped.
- Median or mode imputation strategies used depending on the feature type.

2. Categorical Encoding
- Categorical columns were label encoded or one-hot encoded based on cardinality and importance.
- Binary features were cast to numeric (e.g., Yes/No to 1/0).

3. Numerical Feature Processing
- Some variables were log-transformed to reduce skewness.
- Outliers were optionally capped or removed.

4. Feature Generation
- New interaction features created using domain logic (e.g., ratio between income and liabilities).
- Flags or indicator variables derived from ranges or groupings.

5. Scaling
- StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler applied to numerical features to normalize input distributions.
