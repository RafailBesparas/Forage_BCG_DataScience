    "##### It is important to understand PowerCo clients customers on their behaviour, how much overall energy their are using and how much is dependent on gas. This metric can provide valuable insights into customer behavior that could influence their churn rate, especially when gas and electricity have different pricing structures or service quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the feature is important\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gas Dependence\n",
    "If a customer relies more heavily on gas (the percentage of gas consumption is high), they may be more sensitive to issues related to gas supply, pricing changes, or service disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if gas prices rise significantly or if there's an issue with gas availability, gas-dependent customers are more likely to churn in search of better pricing or more reliable service.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Electricity vs. Gas Consumption:\n",
    "Customers with a balanced mix of electricity and gas usage may have more options to switch between different types of energy suppliers (if applicable) or energy solutions, which could affect their churn behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "For customers who rely mainly on one type of energy (gas), their loyalty to PowerCo could be more tied to the reliability and pricing of that specific service. If their gas consumption forms a large part of their total consumption and they face dissatisfaction with gas prices or service, they may consider switching providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Price Sensitivity:\n",
    "This feature also acts as a proxy for price sensitivity. If a customer is highly dependent on gas, they may be more affected by price hikes or fluctuations in energy tariffs. Conversely, customers with minimal gas usage may be more focused on their electricity consumption and less sensitive to gas-related price changes."

    "##### The result is the total duration of the contract, which is in days, months, years, uncovering long term and short term customer. Newly acquired and loyal .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why it is important\n",
    "Is important for understanding churn rate because it gives insights into customer loyalty, satisfaction, and the likelihood of churn based on how long a customer has been with the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Longer Contracts Often Indicate Higher Loyalty\n",
    "Customers who have been with the company for a longer period (with a longer contract duration) tend to be more loyal. These customers are more likely to stay with the company, especially if their needs have been met over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn Insights: A shorter contract duration may indicate that the customer is newer, and possibly less committed to the service. Customers with short contract durations or who are nearing the end of their contract may be at a higher risk of churning when the contract expires.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Risk of Churn Increases Near Contract Expiry:\n",
    "Interpretation: As customers approach the end of their contract, they may be evaluating whether to renew, switch providers, or change their services. The likelihood of churn often increases in this period if there are negative experiences or lack of renewal incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn Insights: A shorter contract duration may suggest that a customer could be nearing contract renewal time, which is a critical period to retain them. Monitoring contract renewal dates and the duration before renewal can help the company act proactively, for example, by offering renewal incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Customer Lifecycle Management\n",
    "New customers (shorter contract duration) may need additional support to enhance satisfaction and avoid early churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loyal customers (longer contract duration) may benefit from loyalty programs or discounts to keep them from switching providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn Insights: Customers who have been with the company for a longer period might be less sensitive to price changes or minor service disruptions, but may need different retention strategies to keep them satisfied over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Early Warning for Short-Term Contracts:\n",
    "Interpretation: Short contracts (e.g., 6 months or 1 year) could imply that the customer may be testing the service or could be more likely to switch providers when their contract expires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn Insights: Customers with short contracts may need additional incentives (e.g., loyalty programs, better pricing, customized offers) to encourage them to renew. Identifying early if the customer is in their contract's final months allows the company to take preventative measures before they churn."

    "# Price Sensitivity Variance Analysis\n",
    "##### var_6m_price_peak_var: This represents the variance in the price of energy during peak hours over the last 6 months. Variance here measures how much the price has fluctuated during this period.\n",
    "##### var_year_price_peak_var: This represents the variance in the price of energy during peak hours over the last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Explanation:\n",
    "Calculates the ratio between the 6-month price variance and the 1-year price variance. A higher ratio suggests that prices are more volatile in the short term (6 months) compared to the long term (1 year), which could imply higher price sensitivity from customers in the short term.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result Explanation\n",
    "##### High Ratio:\n",
    "A higher value for this feature indicates that the price volatility in the last 6 months is higher compared to the price volatility over the past year. This may imply that customers are more sensitive to recent price fluctuations, which could increase the risk of churn, especially if recent price increases have been significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Low Ratio:\n",
    "A lower value means that the 6-month price volatility is relatively stable when compared to the 1-year volatility, which may indicate that price sensitivity is lower, and customers may not be as affected by short-term fluctuations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why it is important for the Churn rate\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Customer Price Sensitivity:\n",
    "Customers who experience high price volatility in the short term (6 months) may feel uncertain about their future bills, which increases the likelihood of churn. This feature can help identify those at greater risk based on recent price fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Price Stability:\n",
    "If a customer is exposed to less price volatility in the last 6 months compared to the last year, they may feel more confident in sticking with the provider, reducing churn risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Churn Prediction:\n",
    "Understanding the ratio of short-term to long-term price volatility can help predict which customers are more likely to churn based on their exposure to recent price changes."
