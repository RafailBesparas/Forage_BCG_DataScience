# üìÅ Dataset Description
- The dataset consists of three CSV files capturing client characteristics, pricing context, and a preprocessed version for modeling.

- client_data.csv: Contains customer attributes and financial information.
- price_data.csv: Contains product or market price-related data.
- clean_data_after_eda.csv: Merged and cleaned dataset after exploratory data analysis (EDA), ready for modeling.
